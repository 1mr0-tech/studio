Then, answer the user's question, which is '{{userQuestion}}'. Your response must be structured according to the output schema. For the 'answer' field, provide a direct and concise answer based only on the information found in the documents. You must always populate the 'implementation' field for GCP, AWS, and Azure. If the user's question is technical, asking 'how to' or for steps, provide a detailed step-by-step guide in the implementation field. Each step must have a 'command' with an executable CLI command or console instructions, and a 'referenceUrl' with an official documentation link. For non-technical questions, provide general security best practices instead, where the 'command' can be a brief note and 'referenceUrl' can be a relevant article link or empty. If you cannot find an answer in the documents, you must set 'answerFound' to false, state in the 'answer' field that the information was not found, set 'suggestsImagination' to true, and provide an 'imaginationSuggestion' inviting the user to ask again using your general knowledge. Even in this case, still try to populate the 'implementation' field with general best practices.`;
